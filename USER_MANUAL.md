# AI Sticker Studio - User Manual

Welcome to the AI Sticker Studio! This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to create amazing, personalized stickers, wallpapers, and photo remixes using the power of generative AI.

## 1. Getting Started: The Interface

The application is divided into two main areas: the **Control Panel** on the left, where you configure your creation, and the **Preview Panel** on the right, where you see your results.

### 1.1. The Header Bar

At the top of the screen, you'll find several important tools:

-   **Undo/Redo:** Step backward or forward through your recent setting changes.
-   **Layout Switcher:** Change the arrangement of the Control and Preview panels to suit your screen size. 'Auto' is recommended.
-   **Credits Display:** Shows your current credit balance. Most AI actions cost credits.
-   **Dev Log:** A changelog showing the latest updates and fixes to the application.
-   **About:** Information about the application and its technologies.
-   **Restart:** Starts a fresh session. Your credits and character library will be saved, but your current settings and results will be cleared.

### 1.2. The Control Panel Tabs

The Control Panel has three main tabs, each leading to a different creative studio:

-   üé® **Stickers:** Create personalized static or animated stickers.
-   üñºÔ∏è **Wallpapers:** Design stunning wallpapers featuring your saved characters.
-   ‚ú® **Remix:** Transform any photo into a new, imaginative scene.

## 2. The Sticker Studio

This is where you can create stickers of a real person (using a photo) or any character you can imagine (using text).

### Step 1: Choose Your Input Mode

-   **From Image:** Select this to create stickers that look like a specific person. This mode uses our powerful **"Identity Lock"** feature.
-   **From Text:** Select this to create stickers of anything else, like "a wizard cat" or "a samurai pizza slice."

### Step 2: Define Your Subject & Identity

This is the most important step for creating personalized stickers.

#### If using "From Image":

1.  **Upload Your Photo:** Click, drag-and-drop, or paste a clear, well-lit photo of a person's face.
2.  **Automatic Calibration:** The moment you upload, the AI performs a one-time analysis of the person's facial structure. This costs **1 credit** and creates an **"Identity Lock"**.
    -   **What is Identity Lock?** It's a digital "faceprint" that tells the AI how to draw the person's face accurately, ensuring all your stickers look like them, even with different expressions.
3.  **Status:** The "Identity Lock Status" will change from `Not Calibrated` to `‚úì Locked`. You are now ready to generate!

> **üí° Tip:** For best results, use a photo where the person is facing forward and their face is not obscured by shadows, hair, or hands.

#### If using "From Text":

1.  **Subject:** Describe the main character (e.g., "a happy robot").
2.  **Key Characteristics:** Add more details (e.g., "holding a flower, has one big eye").

### Step 3: Choose Expressions

Select one or more expressions from the grid.

-   **(Pose from image):** This special expression (only available in "From Image" mode) tells the AI to use the exact pose from your original uploaded photo.
-   **Speech Bubbles:** After selecting an expression, a small bubble icon appears. Click it to add custom text that will appear in a speech bubble on that sticker.

### Step 4: Style Your Sticker

-   **Style:** The overall artistic look (e.g., Cartoon Vector, 3D Render, Watercolor).
-   **Palette, Line Style, Shading:** Fine-tune the colors and details. Note that some options may be disabled as they are not compatible with the main `Style` you've chosen.
-   **Composition:** Choose how the character is framed (e.g., Headshot, Full-Body).

### Step 5: Choose Your Output Format

-   **Static Pack:** Create a set of still images.
    -   **Pack Size:** Choose how many stickers to generate.
    -   **Auto-fill:** If you select fewer expressions than your pack size (e.g., you choose 2 expressions for a 4-pack), the AI will automatically pick 2 random expressions to complete the pack for you.
-   **Animated (Video):** Create a single, looping animated video.
    -   **Animation Style:** Choose from a list of preset animation styles. Click the "Examples" button to see a preview gallery of each animation.
    -   **Advanced Settings:** For more control, expand the "Advanced Animation Settings" to adjust the **Speed**, **Loop Style** (e.g., infinite, bounce), and **Easing Function** (e.g., linear, ease-in-out) of your animation.

### Generating Your Stickers

The "Generate" button at the bottom shows the total credit cost. Clicking it will open a confirmation dialog. Once confirmed, the generation process begins in the Preview Panel!

## 3. The Wallpaper Studio

Design custom wallpapers for your phone or desktop, featuring characters you've created or saved.

### Step 1: Manage Your Characters

-   **The Character Library:** This grid shows all your saved characters.
-   **Importing a Character:**
    -   **From a Photo (Costs Credits):** Upload a photo of a person. The AI will analyze them and save them as a new character.
    -   **From a Sticker (Free):** If you upload an image with a transparent background (like a sticker you've already made), the app will import it as a character for free.
-   **Selecting Characters:** Click on one or more characters in your library to include them in the wallpaper.

### Step 2: Design the Background Scene

-   **Custom Prompt:** Write a description of the scene you want to create (e.g., "A mystical forest at night with glowing mushrooms").
-   **Preset Browser:** Browse a huge library of pre-made ideas, organized by category. Click one to use it.
-   **AI Prompt Assistant:** Type a simple theme (like "lonely astronaut") into the text box and click "Suggest". The AI will generate several creative prompt ideas for you.

### Step 3: Review Recent Generations

-   **History at a Glance:** This section displays thumbnails of the last 10 wallpapers you've generated.
-   **Quick Actions:** Hover over a recent generation to quickly re-download it or add it to your main collection.

### Step 4: Advanced Composition

-   **Smart Context Adaptation:** This is a powerful feature! When enabled, the AI will try to blend your character into the scene realistically by matching the lighting, colors, and shadows. This helps avoid a "pasted on" look.
-   **Other Settings:** You can also control the character's position, size, and the overall quality of the wallpaper.

## 4. The Photo Remix Studio

Transform any photo into a work of art. The AI will automatically cut out the main subject(s) and place them in a brand-new, AI-generated scene.

1.  **Upload Your Photo:** Upload any photo you want to remix. The AI will show you the original "Before" and the AI-powered "Cutout" of the main subjects.
2.  **Describe the Scene:**
    -   **Background Prompt:** Describe the new background you want to create.
    -   **Foreground Prompt:** Describe how you want to change the subjects (e.g., "change their clothes to astronaut suits," "give them wizard robes"). Leave this blank to keep them as they are.
3.  **Generate!**
    -   **Simple Mode:** Just click "Generate Remix". The AI will do everything in one step.
    -   **Advanced Mode:** For more control, you can generate each part of the remix step-by-step: Remix the subjects, generate the background, and then composite them together.

## 5. Managing Your Creations

Once you've generated something, you have several options in the **Preview Panel**.

### The Result Grid

Your creations appear in a grid.

-   **Save to Collection:** To save an item, **drag it from the grid and drop it onto the "My Collection" button** at the bottom-right of the screen.

Hover over any item to see a set of action icons:

-   ‚úèÔ∏è **Edit:** Opens the **Post-Processing Studio**, where you can make quick edits like removing the background, adding a speech bubble, or converting the image to an SVG vector.
-   üì• **Download:** Saves the image or video to your device.
-   üìã **Copy Report:** Copies the full prompt and settings to your clipboard, which is useful for sharing or debugging.
-   üë§ **Save as Character:** (For stickers) Saves the character from the sticker to your library for use in wallpapers.
-   üñºÔ∏è **Use in Wallpaper:** (For stickers) Instantly sends the sticker character to the Wallpaper Studio to start a new creation.

### My Collection

The "My Collection" button at the bottom right opens a modal containing all your saved creations. Here you can:

-   Search and filter your collection.
-   Select multiple items to **download as a ZIP file** or **delete in bulk**.
-   **Drag-and-drop** an item from the collection directly back into a workflow (e.g., drag a character into the Wallpaper Studio to select it).

## 6. Troubleshooting & FAQ

-   **Why did my generation fail?**
    This can happen if the AI service is busy or if the prompt violates safety policies. The app will automatically refund your credits. Try again after a few moments.

-   **Why don't my stickers look exactly like the person in the photo?**
    AI is powerful but not perfect. For best results, use a clear, high-quality, front-facing photo for calibration. The "Identity Lock" is very good at preserving features, but complex poses or styles can sometimes alter the likeness.

-   **Why are some style options (like Shading) disabled?**
    The app prevents you from selecting artistically incompatible styles. For example, a "Lineart" style cannot have "Gradient" shading. The UI automatically disables these options for you.

-   **I got an error, but my credits were still used!**
    The app has a built-in refund system. In almost all cases of failure, your credits are automatically and instantly refunded. Check the "Credit Transactions" tab in the `Dev Tools` panel to see credit changes.
