# Stale Comment Audit & Cleanup Report

## 1. Objective
1
This audit was conducted to identify and remove all stale `// FIX:` and `// @fix` comments from the codebase. These comments were remnants from previous development cycles where issues (primarily module import errors and casing mismatches) had already been resolved. Their presence added unnecessary noise and could mislead future developers.

## 2. Audit Process

1.  A global search was performed across all `.ts` and `.tsx` files for the following patterns:
    *   `// FIX:`
    *   `// @fix`
2.  Each located comment was reviewed against the surrounding code to confirm that the described fix was complete and the comment was no longer relevant.
3.  All confirmed stale comments were removed.

## 3. Findings & Actions Taken

The audit identified a total of **11 stale comments** across 7 files. All were related to previously resolved module import paths and casing issues.
