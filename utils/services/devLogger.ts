If AI suggestions fail, users can still proceed with custom prompts. 3) VERIFICATION: Confirmed wallpaper Smart Context Adaptation already correctly reads and analyzes character images BEFORE constructing the final prompt (lines 304-364 in useGeneration.ts).

It now uses a new `performGenericEdit` service function, ensuring that rapid, sequential edits are queued by the `apiSerializer` instead of causing an API burst.\n\n2.  **Unified Wallpaper Generation:** The powerful unified scene generation call in the "Smart Context Adaptation" workflow now goes through a new `generateUnifiedWallpaperScene` service function. This ensures that even this complex, one-off generation is correctly paced and queued within the global API serialization system.\n\nWith these changes, **100% of all outbound Gemini API calls** are now managed by the application\'s resilience suite (`apiSerializer`, circuit breaker, rate limiter), guaranteeing stability and preventing rate limit errors across all features.',

        details: 'Implemented a robust, multi-layered architectural solution to fix a critical race condition that caused API rate limit errors (`429 Too Many Requests`) during rapid image uploads. The previous event-driven workflow could trigger multiple, concurrent `autoCalibrate` instances, overwhelming the Gemini API.\n\n**The Solution (Defense in Depth):**\n1.  **Global API Serializer (Core Fix):** Introduced a new `apiSerializer` utility that creates a global, concurrency-safe queue for all API calls. Every request is now processed one at a time with a mandatory delay, completely eliminating the API burst that was the root cause of the `429` errors.\n\n2.  **Debounced Trigger:** The `useEffect` in `App.tsx` that triggers auto-calibration has been refactored to use a debounce mechanism. This ensures that a rapid burst of trigger events results in only a single execution of the calibration logic.\n\n3.  **State-Based Guard:** The `calibrationReducer` was enhanced to be state-aware. It now checks if a calibration is already in progress and will ignore subsequent `TRIGGER_AUTO_CALIBRATION` actions, preventing redundant state transitions.\n\n4.  **Function-Level Lock:** As a final safeguard, a `useRef`-based lock was added directly to the `autoCalibrate` function in `useCalibration.ts` to make concurrent execution impossible.\n\nThis comprehensive, layered fix not only resolves the immediate issue but also hardens the entire application against similar race conditions, making it significantly more resilient and reliable.',
