## 4. INPUT MODES: THE FOUNDATION

This is your first major decision: **How do you want to create your sticker?**

### Mode 1: From Image (Image-to-Image)

**What It Does:**
Transforms YOUR face from a photo into stickers while preserving your exact identity across all expressions and styles.

**When to Use:**
- You want stickers that look exactly like you or someone else
- You have a clear photo available  
- You want maximum consistency across expressions
- You need realistic facial features

**Requirements:**
- A clear, well-lit photo showing the full face
- Person should be facing the camera (ideally front-facing or slight angle)
- Good lighting without harsh shadows
- High enough resolution to see facial details
- No obstructions (sunglasses, masks, heavy filters)

**The Process:**
1. Click the upload area
2. Select your photo (supports JPG, PNG, HEIC)
3. System automatically calibrates and locks your identity
4. You can then generate unlimited stickers with that locked identity

**Credit Cost:**
- Initial calibration: **1 credit** (one-time per photo)
- Subsequent generations use the same Identity Lock at no additional calibration cost

### Mode 2: From Text (Text-to-Image)

**What It Does:**
Creates imaginary characters based on text descriptions - no photo needed.

**When to Use:**
- You want to create fictional characters
- You don't have a photo available
- You want abstract or conceptual characters  
- You're creating brand mascots or avatars

**How It Works:**
1. Switch to "From Text" mode
2. In "Subject" field, describe the character (e.g., "A wise wizard cat")
3. In "Key Characteristics" field, add specific details (e.g., "wearing star-patterned robes, has green eyes")
4. Select expressions and styles
5. Generate

**Limitations:**
- No Identity Lock (each generation may look slightly different)
- Less control over specific facial features  
- Cannot guarantee exact likeness across multiple generations
- Better for fantasy/cartoon characters than realistic people

**Credit Cost:**
- No calibration cost
- Each sticker in pack costs 1 credit

### Switching Between Modes

You can freely switch modes at any time:
- Switching FROM "Image" TO "Text": Your calibrated identity is preserved but not used
- Switching FROM "Text" TO "Image": You need to upload and calibrate a photo

## 5. IDENTITY LOCK SYSTEM: THE MAGIC

### What is Identity Lock?

Identity Lock is the proprietary technology that makes AI Sticker Studio unique. It's a sophisticated AI system that analyzes your facial structure and preserves your exact likeness across all generated stickers, regardless of expression, pose, or artistic style.

**The Problem It Solves:**
Without Identity Lock, each AI-generated image would look like a different person. Your "laughing" sticker might have different eyes than your "wink" sticker. Identity Lock ensures ALL your stickers look unmistakably like YOU.

### How Identity Lock Works (V2 System)

The system uses a **4-step forensic analysis process**:

#### **Step 1: Upload & Initial Analysis**
When you upload a photo:
- System performs immediate subject detection
- Checks photo quality and lighting
- Warns you if photo may produce suboptimal results

#### **Step 2: Neutral Reference Generation**
The AI creates a "forensic faceprint":
- Removes your current expression and pose
- Creates perfectly forward-facing, neutral portrait
- Removes accessories (glasses, hats, jewelry)
- Applies even studio lighting
- **Purpose**: Creates emotionless baseline for comparison

#### **Step 3: Biometric Profile Extraction**
The AI performs forensic facial analysis extracting:

**Bone Structure:**
- Face shape (oval, round, square, heart, diamond)
- Jawline prominence and angle
- Cheekbone height and prominence
- Chin shape and projection
- Forehead height and width

**Eye Biometrics:**
- Iris color (precise, not just "brown")
- Eye shape (almond, round, hooded, upturned, downturned)
- Pupillary distance (wide-set, average, close-set)
- Eyelid type (monolid, single, double, hooded)
- Eyebrow shape and thickness

**Nose Structure:**
- Bridge width and height
- Nostril shape
- Tip shape
- Overall size

**Mouth Features:**
- Upper and lower lip fullness
- Cupid's bow definition
- Mouth width

**Distinctive Features:**
- Dimples (location if present)
- Hair style, length, color, texture
- Earrings (type, location, size)
- Tattoos (exact location and design)
- Piercings
- Markers (moles, freckles, scars with exact locations)

**Skin Tone:**
- Base tone (fair, medium, tan, deep)
- Undertones (cool, warm, neutral)

#### **Step 4: Identity Fingerprint Creation**
The biometric profile is compressed into a compact "identity fingerprint" (max 150 words) that:
- Prioritizes most distinctive features
- Uses precise, measurable language
- Emphasizes features that survive style transformations
- Becomes the reference used in all generation prompts

### The Calibration Process

####  **Automatic Calibration** (Default & Recommended)

When you upload a photo, the system AUTOMATICALLY:
1. Deducts 1 credit
2. Performs all 4 analysis steps
3. Creates complete Identity Anchor
4. Auto-approves and locks identity
5. You're ready to generate immediately

**Time**: 10-15 seconds  
**Cost**: 1 credit (one-time)  
**User Action**: None required!

#### **Manual Calibration** (Legacy Method)

Available if you prefer verification step:
1. Upload photo
2. Click "Calibrate" button
3. System shows you "Before" (your photo) vs "After" (AI's neutral faceprint)
4. You approve or reject
5. If approved, identity is locked

**Time**: 15-20 seconds  
**Cost**: 1 credit  
**Advantage**: You can verify accuracy before locking

### Identity Lock Strength Levels

Once calibrated, you can choose validation strictness:

####  **Off - V1 System (Fastest)**
- Uses basic identity template
- No validation or retry
- Fastest generation
- Good for: Quick iterations, less critical accuracy

####  **Standard - V2 System (Recommended)**
- Uses complete Identity Anchor with neutral reference
- Validates each generated sticker (similarity score 85%+)
- 1 generation attempt per sticker
- Auto-retries if validation fails
- **Best balance of speed and accuracy**

####  **Maximum - V2 System (Highest Accuracy)**
- Same as Standard but allows up to 3 attempts per sticker
- Will retry up to 2 times if validation fails
- Ensures 85%+ similarity score
- Slower but produces most consistent results
- Good for: Final packs, important projects

### Understanding the Identity Lock Status Indicator

In Section 2, you'll see a status box showing:

**"Not Calibrated"** (Yellow)
- No photo uploaded yet, OR
- Photo uploaded but calibration hasn't run
- You cannot generate stickers yet

**"Processing..."** (Purple, Animated)
- Photo is being analyzed
- System is creating your Identity Anchor
- Wait for this to complete

**"Calibrating..."** (Purple, Animated)
- AI is performing the 4-step analysis
- Usually takes 10-15 seconds
- Don't close the browser!

**"âœ“ Locked"** (Green)
- Identity successfully calibrated and locked
- You can now generate stickers
- This identity will be used for all generations

- Detail level: Less facial detail, more scene
- Creates: Dynamic, action-oriented stickers

---

### Style Compatibility System

The system uses a smart compatibility matrix (STYLE_COMPATIBILITY constant) that automatically:
1. Filters incompatible line styles based on chosen artistic style
2. Filters incompatible shading styles
3. Disables dropdowns when only 1 option is valid
4. Prevents artistic incoherence

**Example:**
- Choose "Photorealistic" â†’  Line Style auto-sets to "None" (photos don't have outlines)
- Choose "Lineart" â†’ Shading auto-sets to "None" (lineart doesn't use shading)

**You cannot create:**
- Photorealistic image with Bold outlines (makes no sense)
- Lineart with Cel-shading (contradictory)
- 3D Render with Hand-drawn lines (incompatible concepts)

This **prevents bad prompts** and ensures every combination produces coherent results!

## 9. PACK & QUALITY SETTINGS

### Pack Size (Static Stickers Only)

**Available Options**: 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20

**How It Works:**
- Pack Size = Number of stickers generated
- Pack Size = Credit cost (1 credit per sticker)
- Example: Pack size 8 = 8 stickers generated = 8 credits

**Special Rules:**

**When "(Pose from image)" is selected:**
- Pack size is DISABLED (locked to 1)
- Cost is always 1 credit
- Reason: This expression uses your exact photo pose

**When selecting fewer expressions than pack size:**
- Example: Select 2 expressions, pack size is 8
- AI generates your 2 selections first
- Then AI randomly selects 6 more expressions to complete the pack
- You get 8 total stickers (2 requested + 6 random)

**Strategy:**
- **Small Packs (1-4)**: Testing styles, specific needs
- **Medium Packs (8-12)**: Good variety, balanced cost
- **Large Packs (16-20)**: Maximum variety, best value per sticker

### Resolution

**Available Options**: 512px, 768px, 1024px

**512px** (Low)
- Fastest generation
- Smallest file sizes
- Good for: Web use, messaging apps
- Quality: Good for small display sizes

**768px** (Medium) â­ RECOMMENDED
- Balanced generation speed
- Moderate file sizes
- Good for: Most uses, social media
- Quality: Sharp on most screens

**1024px** (High)
- Slower generation
- Larger file sizes
- Good for: Printing, large displays, archival
- Quality: Professional, maximum detail

**Note:** Resolution doesn't affect credit cost, only generation time and file size.

## 10. GENERATION PROCESS EXPLAINED

### The Complete Generation Workflow

#### **Phase 1: Pre-Flight Checks**

When you click "Generate", the system performs validation:

1. **Credit Check**: Do you have enough credits?
   - Cost calculation based on output format and pack size
   - If insufficient, shows error: "Insufficient credits. Needs X."

2. **Identity Check** (Image-to-Image mode only):
   - Is Identity Lock confirmed?
   - If not: Shows "Please upload and calibrate an image first"

3. **Expression Check**:
   - At least one expression selected?
   - If not: Shows "Please select at least one expression"

4. **Confirmation Dialog**:
   - Title: "Confirm Sticker Generation" or "Confirm Animation Generation"
   - Shows exactly what will be generated
   - Shows exact credit cost
   - Buttons: Cancel or Confirm

---

#### **Phase 2: Credit Deduction & Initialization**

After you click "Confirm":

1. **Credits Deducted Immediately**
   - Full cost deducted upfront
   - Shows in activity log: "Generation started"
   - Credit transaction logged

2. **State Changes**:
   - `isLoading` set to `true`
   - Previous results cleared
   - Error state cleared
   - Loading message displayed

3. **Expression List Built**:
   - Your selected expressions compiled
   - If pack size > selections, random expressions added
   - List trimmed to exactly pack size
   - "(Pose from image)" gets your photo's pose description injected

---

#### **Phase 3: AI Generation**

**For Static Stickers:**

Sequential generation (one at a time):
1. "Generating sticker 1 of 4: HEY..."
2. AI prompt constructed with:
   - Expert persona ("world-class digital illustrator")
   - Primary directive (preserve identity)
   - Your Identity Lock data
   - Expression description
   - All style settings
3. API call to Gemini
4. Image received and validated
5. Repeat for next expression

**Identity Lock V2 Process** (if enabled):
- Each sticker goes through validation
- AI compares generated sticker to neutral reference
- Similarity score calculated (0-100)
- If score < 85%, auto-retry (up to max attempts)
- Validation results stored with each sticker

**For Animated Stickers:**

Different workflow (video generation):
1. "Generating animation... 0%"
2. Submits video generation job to Veo API
3. Polls for completion every 10 seconds
4. Shows progress: "Generating animation... 45%"
5. When complete, downloads video file
6. "Downloading and finalizing animation..."
7. Converts to data URL

**Note:** Animation can be cancelled mid-generation (credits refunded)

---

#### **Phase 4: Results & Collection**

**On Success:**
1. Generated stickers appear in preview area
2. Loading state cleared
3. Success message in activity log
4. All results automatically saved to Collection
5. Results added to "Recent Generations"
6. Metadata stored:
   - Timestamp
   - Credit cost
   - Generation time
   - Model used
   - Validation results (if V2)
   - All settings used

**On Failure:**
1. Error message displayed
2. Credits automatically refunded (full amount)
3. Refund logged in activity
4. Failure result stored in collection (for debugging)
5. Error details saved

---

#### **Phase 5: Post-Generation Actions**

**Quick Actions** (on each sticker):
- **Download**: Save as PNG/MP4 to your device
- **Edit**: Open in Post-Processing Studio (1 credit per edit)
- **View**: Full-screen viewer with zoom
- **Drag to Collection**: Auto-saves for later

**Batch Actions**:
- Download entire pack as ZIP file
- Add all to character library
- Share settings with others

---

## 11. ADVANCED FEATURES

### Identity Lock V2 vs V1

**V1 System** (Legacy):
- Uses basic JSON identity template
- No validation
- No retry logic
- Faster but less consistent

**V2 System** (Current):
- Uses Identity Anchor (neutral reference + biometric profile + fingerprint)
- Validates each generation
- Auto-retry on validation failure
- Slower but highly consistent

**When V2 Runs:**
- Identity Lock Strength set to "Standard" or "Maximum"
- Only in Image-to-Image mode
- Automatically enabled after calibration

**Validation Process:**
1. Generate sticker
2. AI compares to neutral reference
3. Analyzes: face shape, eyes, nose, mouth, distinctive features
4. Calculates similarity score (0-100)
5. If score >= 85%: Valid âœ“
6. If score < 85%: Retry (if attempts remaining)

**Validation Results Shown:**
- Green checkmark: Valid (score >= 85%)
- Yellow warning: May have inconsistencies
- View validation details in Collection modal

---

### Identity Template Editor

**What It Is:**
A JSON editor showing your complete biometric profile.

**How to Access:**
1. Upload and calibrate a photo
2. Scroll down in Section 2
3. Click "Show/Edit Identity Template"

**What You Can Do:**
- View detailed facial analysis
- Manually edit any field
- Fix AI mistakes
- Add custom details
- Save changes

**Common Edits:**
- Hair color if AI got it wrong
- Add missing distinctive features
- Correct gender/age assessments
- Enhance specific details

**Warning:** Manual edits directly affect generation quality. Only edit if you know what you're doing!

---

### Character Creation from Stickers

**What It Does:**
Converts a generated sticker into a reusable Character for the Wallpaper Studio.

**How to Use:**
1. Generate a sticker you love
2. Click "+" button on the sticker
3. Enter character name
4. Character saved to library
5. Can now be used in Wallpaper Studio

**What Gets Saved:**
- The sticker image
- Identity template
- Name
- All biometric data
- Generation settings

**Why This Is Useful:**
- Reuse calibrated identity in wallpapers
- Build character library
- No need to re-calibrate
- Mix characters in wallpaper scenes

---

### Collection Integration

**Drag & Drop from Collection:**
1. Open Collection (button in header)
2. Find a previously generated sticker
3. Drag it to the upload area in Sticker Studio
4. Identity Lock automatically restored
5. You can now generate more stickers with that identity

**Benefits:**
- No re-calibration needed
- Instant identity restoration
- Use previous successful calibrations
- Build on past work

---

### Negative Prompts (Hidden Feature)

The system automatically applies negative prompts to prevent:
- Blurry images
- Low quality
- Text/watermarks
- Distortions
- Multiple faces (when one expected)

These are baked into the generation prompts and cannot be edited via UI (for safety).

## 12. TROUBLESHOOTING & FAQs

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### **Problem: "Your calibrated image has expired or could not be found"**

**Cause:** Image cache cleared or expired (browser storage limit reached)

**Solutions:**
1. Re-upload your photo
2. System will auto-calibrate again (costs 1 credit)
3. Or drag a previous sticker from Collection to restore identity

**Prevention:**
- Don't clear browser data
- Save important stickers to Collection
- Keep backup of original photos

---

#### **Problem: Generated stickers don't look like me**

**Possible Causes & Fixes:**

**Cause 1: Poor quality photo**
- Solution: Use clear, front-facing, well-lit photo
- Check: Can you clearly see all facial features in original?

**Cause 2: Identity Lock Strength too low**
- Solution: Change from "Off" to "Standard" or "Maximum"
- Location: Section 2, after calibration

**Cause 3: Incompatible artistic style**
- Solution: Try Cartoon Vector or Sticker Style first
- Some styles (WPAP, Dotwork) are harder for identity preservation

**Cause 4: Validation failed but went unnoticed**
- Solution: Check Collection, look for yellow warnings
- Re-generate with Maximum strength

---

#### **Problem: "Generation failed because the AI could not maintain identity consistency"**

**What This Means:**
Identity Lock V2 tried multiple times but couldn't achieve 85% similarity score.

**Solutions:**
1. **Try different style:**
   - Switch from complex (WPAP) to simple (Cartoon Vector)
   - Avoid Dotwork, Tritone for critical identity matches

2. **Increase Identity Lock Strength:**
   - Change to "Maximum" (allows 3 attempts)
   - Gives AI more chances to get it right

3. **Re-calibrate with better photo:**
   - Use clearer, better-lit photo
   - Ensure face is fully visible
   - Remove accessories

4. **Switch to V1 System:**
   - Set strength to "Off"
   - Faster but less validated
   - Good for testing

---

#### **Problem: Animation generation stuck at 95%**

**What's Happening:**
Video is rendering (final step takes longest)

**Normal Behavior:**
- Progress reaches 95% quickly
- Then stays there for 30-60 seconds
- This is normal! Final rendering is intensive

**If stuck > 3 minutes:**
1. Click "Cancel Generation"
2. Credits will be refunded
3. Try again with simpler animation style

---

#### **Problem: Pack size is disabled / can't change it**

**Cause**: You selected "(Pose from image)" expression

**Why:**
- This expression uses your exact photo
- Only makes sense as single sticker
- System auto-locks pack size to 1

**Solution:**
- Deselect "(Pose from image)" to unlock pack size
- Or keep it selected for cheap 1-credit generation

---

#### **Problem: Line Style / Shading Style dropdown is disabled**

**This is normal!**

**Cause**: Your chosen Artistic Style only supports one option

**Examples:**
- Photorealistic â†’ Line Style must be "None" (photos don't have outlines)
- Lineart â†’ Shading must be "None" (sketches don't have shading)
- WPAP â†’ Lines must be "Bold" (requirement of style)

**This is a feature, not a bug!** The system prevents incompatible combinations.

---

#### **Problem: Stickers have wrong colors / don't match palette**

**Cause**: Some styles override palette for artistic reasons

**Examples:**
- Tritone: Uses exactly 3 colors (ignores palette setting)
- Monochrome Lineart: Uses single color naturally
- Photorealistic: Uses natural skin tones (palette affects background/clothing)

**Expected Behavior:**
- Palette is a suggestion, not absolute rule
- AI prioritizes artistic coherence
- Skin tones stay realistic even with "Vibrant" palette

---

#### **Problem: Speech bubbles not appearing**

**Checklist:**
1. Did you set text for that expression? (blue icon = text set, gray = no text)
2. Is text very long? (may be cut off in final render)
3. Did generation complete successfully?
4. Are you viewing the right sticker?

**Note:** Speech bubbles are baked into the image during generation, not overlaid after.

---

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I edit the Identity Template manually?**
A: Yes! Click "Show/Edit Identity Template" in Section 2 after calibration. Advanced users can fine-tune the AI's analysis.

**Q: How many times can I generate with one Identity Lock?**
A: Unlimited! One calibration (1 credit) unlocks infinite generations with that identity.

**Q: Can I use multiple photos of the same person?**
A: Yes, but you need to calibrate each photo separately (1 credit each). Slight angle/lighting differences create different Identity Locks.

**Q: Why does auto-calibration sometimes take longer?**
A: Complex photos (multiple people, poor lighting, accessories) take longer to analyze. Typical range: 10-20 seconds.

**Q: Can I cancel a generation in progress?**
A: Only for animated stickers! Static generation is fast and cannot be cancelled. Animation shows "Cancel Generation" button.

**Q: What happens to my credits if generation fails?**
A: Full automatic refund! All failures trigger immediate credit refund with log entry.

**Q: Can I download all my stickers at once?**
A: Yes! Collection modal has "Download Selected" feature. Select multiple, click download, get ZIP file.

**Q: Do stickers expire?**
A: Generated stickers stay in Collection permanently (stored in IndexedDB). Image cache may expire after long periods of inactivity.

**Q: Can I use these stickers commercially?**
A: That depends on your license agreement with Google Gemini API and image rights of the source photo.

**Q: Why do some animations not loop perfectly?**
A: This can happen with complex animation styles. Try "Subtle Movement" or "Bouncing" for best loops.

---

### Optimizing for Speed

**Fastest Workflow:**
1. Use "(Pose from image)" expression (1 sticker = 1 credit = fastest)
2. Set Identity Lock Strength to "Off" (skips validation)
3. Use simple styles: Cartoon Vector, Flat
4. Use lower resolution: 512px
5. Avoid animations (2-3 minutes vs 10 seconds)

**Estimated Times:**
- Single static sticker (512px, V1): ~5 seconds
- 4-pack static (768px, V2 Standard): ~25-35 seconds
- 8-pack static (1024px, V2 Maximum): ~60-90 seconds
- Single animation: ~2-3 minutes

---

### Optimizing for Quality

**Highest Quality Workflow:**
1. Upload professional-quality photo (good lighting, sharp focus)
2. Manually verify calibration (approve faceprint)
3. Set Identity Lock Strength to "Maximum"
4. Choose proven styles: Cartoon Vector, Sticker Style, 3D Render
5. Use 1024px resolution
6. Select expressions carefully (avoid too many in one pack)
7. Use Vibrant palette for best color depth

**Quality Indicators:**
- Validation score: 95-100 = Perfect match
- Validation score: 85-94 = Strong match (acceptable)
- Validation score: <85 = AI will retry (if strength allows)

---

### Credit Management Tips

**Earning Credits:**
- Check if your instance provides free credits
- Some deployments refresh credits daily
- Plan generations around credit availability

**Spending Wisely:**
- **Calibration (1 credit):** Essential investment - unlocks unlimited generations
- **Testing styles:** Use pack size 1-2 to test before committing to large pack
- **Animations:** Expensive (1 credit) but impactful - use sparingly
- **Post-processing:** Each edit costs 1 credit - plan edits carefully

**Avoiding Waste:**
- Double-check all settings before generating
- Use Preview-focused layout to see results clearly
- Save successful configurations for reuse
- Don't re-calibrate same photo unnecessarily

---

### Workflow Recommendations

#### **Beginner Workflow** (Minimize decisions)
1. Input Mode: From Image
2. Upload clear photo â†’ Wait for auto-calibration
3. Select 4 expressions from "Recommended First Pack" above
4. Leave style at Cartoon Vector
5. Leave palette at Vibrant
6. Pack size: 4
7. Generate!

**Result:** Reliable, high-quality first pack in ~30 seconds.

---

#### **Advanced Workflow** (Maximum control)
1. Upload photo
2. Manually calibrate (verify faceprint)
3. Edit Identity Template if needed
4. Select expressions thoughtfully (themed pack)
5. Experiment with artistic style
6. Adjust palette to match style
7. Set Identity Lock Strength to Maximum
8. Use higher resolution (1024px)
9. Generate and review validation scores

2. Calibrate carefully
3. Create master character in Character Library
4. Design themed expression packs (8-12 stickers each)
5. Maintain style consistency across packs
6. Archive successful generations
7. Document settings for reproduction
8. Export collections for backup

---

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

âŒ **Using low-quality photos**
- Blurry, dark, filtered photos produce inconsistent results
- AI can't preserve identity it can't clearly see

âŒ **Selecting too many random expressions**
- Unfocused packs lack thematic coherence
- Better to create multiple themed packs

âŒ **Ignoring style compatibility**
- The system auto-filters for a reason!
- Don't fight the disabled dropdowns

âŒ **Not checking validation results**
- Always review validation scores in V2 mode
- Low scores mean identity wasn't preserved well

âŒ **Clearing browser data frequently**
- Wipes your image cache
- Lose calibrated identities

âŒ **Skipping calibration verification**
- Auto-calibration is accurate, but manual verification helps you understand the system

---

- More efficient than style-hopping

ðŸ’¡ **Composition Matters for Gestures**
- Any expression with "${COMPOSITION_HANDLE}" in description needs Half-Body or Full-Body
- Check expression descriptions if hands/arms are cut off

ðŸ’¡ **Speech Bubbles Add Personality**
- Even default speech bubbles can be customized
- Change "Morning!" to "Morning, beautiful!" for personal touch
- Use emojis in bubbles for extra expressiveness

ðŸ’¡ **Animation Styles Match Expression Energy**
- Calm expressions (Nod, Thinking): Use Subtle Movement or Floating
- Energetic expressions (Celebrating, High Five): Use Bouncing or Spinning
- Shocking expressions (Mind Blown, Gasp): Use Pulsing or Zoom

ðŸ’¡ **Resolution Doesn't Affect Quality Significantly**
- 512px is perfectly fine for messaging apps
- Save 1024px for printing or archival
- Difference is subtle on small screens

## 14. TECHNICAL DEEP DIVE

### Architecture Overview

Sticker Studio is built on a **React `useReducer` architecture** with centralized state management.

#### **Core Technologies:**
- **React 19**: UI framework
- **TypeScript**: Type safety
- **Google Gemini API**: AI processing
- **Veo 2.0**: Video generation
- **IndexedDB**: Persistent storage
- **Vite**: Build tool

---

### State Management

#### **Single Source of Truth**
All application state lives in `AppState` object:
```typescript
interface AppState {
  settings: Settings;           // All sticker configuration
  calibrationStep: CalibrationStep;
  isLoading: boolean;
  credits: number;
  results: GeneratedResult[];
  // ... and more
}
```

#### **Immutable State Updates**
Every change creates a new state object:
```typescript
// CORRECT:
return { ...state, credits: state.credits - cost };

// WRONG (mutation):
state.credits -= cost;
```

#### **Action-Based Updates**
All state changes go through dispatched actions:
```typescript
dispatch({ type: 'SET_SETTING', payload: { style: 'Kawaii' } });
dispatch({ type: 'START_GENERATION', payload: 'Generating...' });
dispatch({ type: 'GENERATION_COMPLETE', payload: results });
```

---

### The Generation Pipeline

#### **Hook Architecture:**

**useGeneration Hook:**
- Main generation orchestrator
- Handles cost calculation
- Manages confirmation flow
- Executes generation logic
- Handles success/failure

**useCalibration Hook:**
- Identity Lock workflow manager
- Handles all calibration steps
- Manages verification process
- Credit deduction/refund for calibration

**useImageUpload Hook:**
- Image upload handling
- Cache management
- Pre-analysis triggering

---

### API Integration

#### **Models Used:**

**Image Generation:**
- Model: `gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview`
- Use: Static sticker generation, image editing
- Input: Image + Text prompt
- Output: Image (base64)

**Video Generation:**
- Model: `veo-2.0-generate-001`
- Use: Animated sticker generation
- Input: Image + Text prompt
- Output: Video file (downloaded from URL)

**Text Analysis:**
- Model: `gemini-2.5-flash`
- Use: Face analysis, pose description, JSON responses
- Input: Image (for analysis) or Text
- Output: JSON or Text

#### **API Safety Layers:**

**1. Circuit Breaker:**
- Prevents cascade failures
- Opens circuit after 5 consecutive failures
- Auto-resets after cooldown period

**2. Rate Limiter:**
- Prevents API quota exhaustion
- Enforces minimum delays between calls
- Token bucket algorithm

**3. Request Deduplication:**
- Prevents duplicate simultaneous requests
- Saves credits and API quota

**4. API Serializer:**
- Queues concurrent requests
- Executes sequentially
- Prevents race conditions

**5. Network Monitoring:**
- Detects offline/online status
- Warns user before API calls
- Prevents failed requests

---

### Credit System

#### **Transaction Logging:**
Every credit change is logged with:
- Amount (positive or negative)
- Reason (e.g., "Sticker generation", "Failed refund")
- Timestamp
- Metadata (pack size, output format, etc.)

#### **Automatic Refunds:**
ALL failures trigger immediate refunds:
```typescript
try {
  // Deduct credits
  dispatch({ type: 'CHANGE_CREDITS_BY', payload: { amount: -cost }});
  // Perform generation
  const result = await generate();
} catch (error) {
  // Auto-refund on failure
  dispatch({ type: 'CHANGE_CREDITS_BY', payload: { amount: cost }});
}
```

**Refund Scenarios:**
- Generation fails (any error)
- User cancels animation
- Validation fails repeatedly
- Network error
- API error

---

### Identity Lock V2 Technical Details

#### **The Identity Anchor Object:**

```typescript
interface IdentityAnchor {
  sourceImageBase64: string;          // Original photo
  biometricProfile: BiometricProfile; // Complete facial analysis
  neutralFaceBase64: string;          // Generated neutral reference
  identityFingerprint: string;        // Compact 150-word description
}
```

#### **Generation with Identity Lock:**

**Prompt Structure:**
```
ðŸ”’ IDENTITY-LOCKED GENERATION

=== PRIORITY ORDER ===
1. FACIAL IDENTITY (must match exactly)
2. Target expression
3. Visual style

=== IDENTITY ANCHOR ===
[Identity fingerprint inserted here]

=== TASK ===
Expression: Laughing
Style: Cartoon Vector

=== MANDATORY CONSTRAINTS ===
Generated image MUST maintain:
- Exact bone structure
- Precise eye characteristics
- Identical nose structure
- Same lip shape
- Skin tone consistency
[+ Distinctive features if present]

=== STYLE RULES ===
- Apply style to CLOTHING/BACKGROUND/EFFECTS only
- Facial features stay photorealistic-accurate
- If style conflicts with identity, IDENTITY WINS
```

#### **Validation Algorithm:**

1. **Compare** generated image to neutral reference
2. **Analyze** face shape, eyes, nose, mouth, features
3. **Score** similarity (0-100)
4. **Scoring Rubric:**
   - 95-100: Perfect match (rare)
   - 85-94: Strong match âœ“ VALID
   - 70-84: Recognizable but notable differences
   - <70: Identity not preserved âœ— FAILED

5. **Decision:**
   - Score >= 85: Accept
   - Score < 85 AND attempts remaining: Retry
   - Score < 85 AND no attempts left: Accept with warning

### Performance Optimizations

#### **Image Caching:**
- All images stored in IndexedDB
- Prevents re-downloading
- Faster preview loading
- Survives page refresh

#### **State Persistence:**
- Entire app state saved to IndexedDB
- Auto-saves on every change
- Survives browser crash
- Enables undo/redo system

#### **Component Memoization:**
- StickerStudioWorkflow uses React.memo
- Prevents unnecessary re-renders
- Custom equality check
- Only re-renders when relevant props change

#### **Lazy Loading:**
- Expression icons lazy-loaded
- Animation gallery on-demand
- Modals rendered only when open

---
