# Assistant Compliance Instructions (Mandatory)

These instructions are binding for any AI assistant operating on this repository. You must follow these steps before making any change.

## 1) Read Before Action (All Three Files)
- Read `AGENTS.md` (root)
- Read `instructions.md` (root)
- Read `compliance/observations-2025-10-09.md`
- Read (if more than one)

You must confirm in your response that you read all three before proposing work.

## 2) Discovery Pass (Read-Only)
- Perform a codebase scan to verify compliance with the above documents.
- Identify any pending tasks or violations (e.g., model selection, AiCore usage, prompt persona consistency).
- Summarize findings and propose precise edits. Do not write code yet.

## 3) Permission Gate
- Present a clear, itemized plan of edits with filenames and high-level changes.
- Wait for explicit user approval before writing any code.

## 4) Implementation Order (When Approved)
1. Update `types.ts` first if new state/actions are required.
2. Implement or update logic in the appropriate `hooks/` or `reducers/`.
3. Update UI components in `components/`.
4. Add a new entry to the top of `DEV_LOG` in `services/devLogger.ts` describing changes.

## 5) API & Credits Rules (Non-Negotiable)
- Read API key from `process.env.API_KEY` only.
- Models:
  - Image Editing: `gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview`
  - Image Generation: `imagen-4.0-generate-001`
  - Text/JSON: `gemini-2.5-flash`
- Wrap paid API calls in `try...catch`; on failure, refund credits via `CHANGE_CREDITS_BY` with a positive amount and log the event.

## 6) UX & Styling
- Use Tailwind classes. Maintain the dark "AI core" aesthetic with purple accent.
- Always set `isLoading` and `loadingMessage`; on failure set `error`.
- Use `<AiCore />` for primary loading/placeholder states.

## 7) Prompt Engineering
- Use explicit personas and a strict rule hierarchy for identity preservation.
- Be specific about output requirements (e.g., transparent background).

## 8) Delivery Checklist (Must Confirm in Response)
- [ ] I read `AGENTS.md`, `instructions.md`, and this file.
- [ ] I performed a read-only scan and requested permission.
- [ ] If approved, I updated `types.ts` first (if needed).
- [ ] I implemented logic in `hooks/` or `reducers/`.
- [ ] I updated UI components.
- [ ] I added a new `DEV_LOG` entry.

Failure to follow this document is a policy violation.

## 9) Observations Lifecycle (After Approval)
- Upon user approval to proceed, you MUST record or update audit observations in `compliance/`:
  1. File naming: `observations-YYYY-MM-DD.md` (UTC date). If a file for that date exists, append a new "Revision" subsection with timestamp and deltas.
  2. Use the standard template in `compliance/observations-template.md` including:
     - Summary
     - Status Table (Open, Approved, In Progress, Completed)
     - Detailed Observations (each with Action, Owner, ETA, Status, Notes)
     - Revisions (timestamped change log)
     - Verification (code references and whether addressed)
     - References
  3. Update `compliance/observations-index.json` with: latest file, date, statusCounts, and lastRevisionTimestamp.
  4. Only after updating observations, implement approved changes and add a corresponding `DEV_LOG` entry.

## 10) Observation Codes & Mapping
- Assign a short code to each observation (e.g., `MODEL-001`, `API-002`, `UX-003`).
- For each code, link the governing rule in `AGENTS.md`/`instructions.md` to ensure traceability.

## 11) Permission Request Template (Paste in Requests)
- Files to edit:
- Actions (1â€“3 bullets):
- Impact (user-facing, credits, risk):
- Rollback plan:
- DEV_LOG summary:

## 12) Concurrency Lock for Multi-Assistant Safety
- Before implementation, set a lock in `compliance/observations-index.json`:
  - `lockedBy` (identifier), `lockTimestamp` (ISO), `lockExpiresAt` (ISO; default 30 min)
- Clear or refresh the lock on completion. Do not proceed if another valid lock exists.

## 13) Archival Policy
- When all items in a dated observations file are Completed and Verified, add `archivedAt` (ISO) to the index and stop modifying that file.

## 14) Attribution & Audit Metadata (No Code Footprints)
- Do NOT add signatures/stamps inside source files or comments.
- Required metadata locations:
  1. DEV_LOG entries: include assistant, model, sessionId in details (or add fields if schema allows).
  2. Observations files: add an `Authors` block at the top with assistant, model, sessionId, commit.
  3. Observations index: set `lastActor`, `lastActorModel`, and `lastActorSessionId` when updating.
  4. Commits/PRs: include trailers in commit messages and PR description.
